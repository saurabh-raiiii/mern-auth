# MERN Authentication

## 📌 Project Description
This project provides a complete authentication system built using the MERN stack. It includes login and signup functionality. New users can create an account, and after logging in, they must verify their email using an OTP. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by entering their email, verifying the OTP, and setting a new password. The system ensures security by encrypting passwords before storing them in the database.
